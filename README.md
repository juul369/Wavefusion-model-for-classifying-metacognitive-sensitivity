This code builds upon the original work found at [bridenmj - metacognition](https://github.com/bridenmj/Metacognition/blob/main/README.md). 
It includes three additional scripts: preprocessing.py for preparing the input data, and accuracy.py and topoplot.py for generating the outputs specified in the original paper. 
The existing scripts have been modified to classify both metacognitive confidence and sensitivity.
